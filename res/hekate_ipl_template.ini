# This disables kernel patching and CFW kips.
# Includes exosphere and warmboot, ONLY when >= 7.0.0 and Erista.
# Includes exosphere on Mariko.
# Exosphere/warmboot are not identifiable as it is now.
# This is the closest to OFW, especially when AutoRCM is needed.

[Atmo Vanilla]
fss0=atmosphere/package3
kip1=atmosphere/kips/*

# Note:
# The above adheres to emummc.ini. It will launch emuMMC if enabled, otherwise sysMMC.
# The kip1 line can be omitted if wanted. It's in example in order to mimic fusee behavior.



[Atmo EMU]
fss0=atmosphere/package3
emummcforce=1

[Atmo SYS]
fss0=atmosphere/package3
emummc_force_disable=1

# Note:
# You can have 2 entries of everything where one can boot with emuMMC and one without,
#  via the emummc_force_disable=1 and emummcforce=1 keys. Like the examples above.
# These 2 entries allow user to easily boot enforceable SYS or EMU CFW
# emummcforce=1 makes sure that emuMMC is enabled otherwise it will error out
#  in order to protect user from booting SYS without knowing.
# emummc_force_disable=1 disables emuMMC and allows user to boot SYS CFW
#  even if emuMMC is enabled.



[Atmo EMU2]
fss0=atmosphere/package3
emupath=emuMMC/SD02
emummcforce=1

# Note:
# The above allows you to swap emuMMC on the fly while booting.
# The path defined is the main path of emuMMC folder, for example
#  emuMMC/RAW1, emuMMC/RAW2, emuMMC/SD00, emuMMC/TEST, etc.
# Only works with emuMMC created/migrated via hekate.



[Atmo with extra kips]
fss0=atmosphere/package3
kip1=cfw/mods/mods_extra/*
kip1=cfw/mods/mods_extra/single/extra.kip

# Note:
# The above can be used with any fss0 entry. Like the ones above.
# You can even override atmosphere (fss0) kips with this.
# The wildcard '*' like above can be used to load all kips from a selected directory.

kip1patch=name_of_patch
kip1=cfw/mods/mods_extra/*
kip1=cfw/mods/mods_extra/single/extra.kip

# Note:
# Both options for kip1 can be used. Wildcard and single.
#  You can override kips loaded from FSS0/PKG3 if you define them after the fss0 key.
# If kip1 patch resides in patches.ini and that file OR the patch for
#  current HOS version does not exist, it will error out.

# hekate - CTCaer mod v5.8.0 .ini template
#
# All entries in this template can have these stylistic keys:
#  like logopath= key which is for bootlogo and icon= key for Nyx icon.
# Other than these, there many other keys to choose from, like the exosphere configuration keys.
# All of them are descibed in the main README.
#
# Atmosphere 1.0.0 changes:
# Entries that use Atmosphere are updated to use package3 instead of fusee-secondary.bin for
#  Atmosphere 1.0.0 and up. If 0.20.1 and older is used, replace package3 with fusee-secondary.bin.
#
#
# NOT TO BE USED AS IS!
#  Pick [config] and then only the needed [sections]. # or { } lines can be ommited.
#  If [config] is not copied, hekate will create one with defaults.
#  If wanted, only the changed defaults can be edited. The rest will be created automatically.
#
# Note: The keys in a section are parsed sequentially.
#  This is important for override order of keys (if any double or matching functionality).

# Disclaimer: There are many combos, that allow hekate to basically boot everything NATIVELY.
#  hekate will ALWAYS do what YOU tell it to do. If you get an error,
#  that means that hekate_ipl.ini was wrongly made or files are missing/corrupt/etc!
